  <p>We like to party

    We like, we like to party

    I've got something to tell ya
    I've got news for you
    Gonna put some wheels in motion
    Get ready 'cause we're coming through (coming through)
    Hey now, hey now, hear what I say now
    Happiness is just around the corner
    Hey now, hey now, hear what I say now
    We'll be there for you
    The Vengabus is coming
    And everybody's jumping
    New York to San Francisco
    An intercity disco
    The wheels of steel are turning
    And traffic lights are burning
    So if you like to party
    Get on and move your body
    We like to party
    We like, we like to party
    We like to party
    We like, we like to party
    Hey now, hey now, hear what I say now
    Happiness is just around the corner
    Hey now, hey now, hear what I say now
    We'll be there for you
    The Vengabus is coming
    And everybody's jumping
    New York to San Francisco

    The wheels of steel are turning
    And traffic lights are burning
    So if you like to party
    Get on and move your body
    The Vengabus is coming
    And everybody's jumping
